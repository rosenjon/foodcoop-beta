        <h4>Design by Cooperation</h4>
        <p>
          We believe that an organization’s digital presence should reflect its values and principles — 
          right down to the way that digital structures are built and organized.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why our process for redesigning the website will embrace the same spirit of cooperation 
          that is so integral to the Park Slope Food Coop itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the coming weeks, we will be launching a Coop-wide survey and a new blog to include you in the 
          design process. Follow along!
